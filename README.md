# Maze

A maze generator and pathfinding visualization project.

## Description

This project demonstrates algorithms for finding the shortest path in a maze. Users can create custom mazes using an interactive grid interface and visualize pathfinding algorithms in action.

## Features

- Interactive maze builder with customizable grid dimensions
- Click cells to create walls and open paths
- Shortest path algorithm implementation

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python app/main.py
```
